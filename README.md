# Performance Analysis of LLMs for Text Style Transfer Tasks in English, Hindi, and Bengali

This repo contains the code and data of the papers: [Multilingual Text Style Transfer: Datasets & Models for Indian Languages](https://aclanthology.org/2024.inlg-main.41/) and [Low-Resource Text Style Transfer for Bangla: Data & Models](https://aclanthology.org/2023.banglalp-1.5/)

## Overview
This repository focuses on Text Style Transfer (TST), specifically sentiment transfer, across nine Indian languages: Bengali, Hindi, Magahi, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Odia, Telugu, and Urdu (we refined and corrected an existing English dataset, and we introduce new human-translated multilingual datasets that parallels its English counterpart.). We introduce dedicated datasets containing 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative style-parallel sentences for each language. Our evaluation covers various benchmark models, including Llama2 and GPT-3.5, categorized into parallel, non-parallel, cross-lingual, and shared learning approaches. Our experiments emphasize the importance of parallel data in TST and the effectiveness of the Masked Style Filling (MSF) technique. Additionally, cross-lingual and joint multilingual learning methods show promise, providing insights for selecting optimal models for specific language and task requirements. This work is the first comprehensive study of TST as sentiment transfer across such a diverse range of languages.
